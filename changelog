V 1.0.0 : Initial commit
    Script takes some romanized Linavic text and runs it through
    a few rules to make it conform to PUA unicode rules in a custom font.
    This PUA unicode is then printed to the console.

V 1.1.0 : Output change
    Script now outputs deromanized PUA text to a file (./output.txt) and
    prints the file name. The contents of this file can then be piped
    to the clipboard. This was done for the purpose of avoiding errors
    occurring from attempting to pipe the console output directly
    to the clipboard, as it was attempting to use cp1252.py and failing
    when encountering PUA characters.

V 1.2.0: New interface, de-romanization corrections
    * Script now uses argparse; takes positional arguments for text
      translation and an optional [-f FILENAME | --file FILENAME] argument
      if the output is to be written to a file, otherwise outputs to the
      console.
    * Sundry errors in the character mapping logic have been corrected.
